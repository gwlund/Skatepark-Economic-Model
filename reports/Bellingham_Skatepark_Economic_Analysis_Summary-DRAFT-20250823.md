## Economic Benefits Framework

### User Benefit Estimation

Based on Travel Cost Model methodology from Des Moines Lauridsen Skatepark study and Washington State recreation economics. This analysis employs transparent, peer-reviewed methodologies with documented data sources to ensure replicability and validity:

**Economic Value Sources:**
- **TCM Base Value:** $61 per user-day (Kemp, 2025)
- **WA State Recreation Value:** $55 per user-day average
- **Consumer Surplus:** $33 billion annually for WA state outdoor recreation

#### Methodology: Washington State Recreation Value Calculation

The **$55 per user-day average** for Washington State outdoor recreation was calculated using data from the [Headwaters Economics 2020 Outdoor Recreation Analysis](https://headwaterseconomics.org/trail/economic-analysis-of-outdoor-recreation-in-washington-state-2020-update/):

**Source Data:**
- **Total Consumer Surplus:** $33 billion annually for WA state outdoor recreation
- **Total Recreation Days:** 600 million recreation days annually
- **Calculation:** $33,000,000,000 Ã· 600,000,000 = **$55.00 per recreation day**

This represents the economic value (consumer surplus) that recreationists derive from outdoor activities in Washington State, making it an appropriate benchmark for local recreation facility benefits.

#### User Type Benefit Adjustments

The analysis applies different multipliers to reflect varying travel costs and usage patterns:

**Local Users: $27.50 per day**
- **Calculation:** $55.00 Ã— 0.5 = $27.50
- **Rationale:** 50% of state average due to:
  - Minimal travel costs (local access)
  - High frequency of use reduces marginal utility
  - Lower opportunity costs for frequent users

**Regional Visitors: $55.00 per day**
- **Calculation:** $55.00 Ã— 1.0 = $55.00
- **Rationale:** 100% of WA state average due to:
  - Moderate travel costs within 2-hour drive radius
  - Less frequent use than locals, higher per-visit value
  - Represents typical outdoor recreation value for Washington residents

**Tourists: $82.50 per day**
- **Calculation:** $55.00 Ã— 1.5 = $82.50
- **Rationale:** 150% of WA state average due to:
  - Significant travel investment (flights, accommodation)
  - Rare/unique experience value for out-of-state visitors
  - Higher income demographics typically associated with long-distance travel
  - Premium value for specialized destination choice

### User Volume Scenarios

**Demographic Context:**
- **Bellingham Population:** ~92,000
- **Regional Draw Area:** ~300,000 (Whatcom County + neighboring areas)
- **Based on Des Moines study** scaled for local demographics

**Daily User Projections:**

| Scenario | Local Users | Regional Visitors | Tourists | Total Users/Day | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Conservative** | 22 | 5 | 3 | 30 | Minimal marketing, basic facility |
| **Moderate** | 45 | 20 | 8 | 73 | Good marketing, quality facility |
| **Optimistic** | 70 | 35 | 15 | 120 | Excellent marketing, world-class facility |
