**Presentation Date:** 9/23/2025  
**Version Date:** 202509141430

## Introduction Section

This report summarizes the economic impact and return on investment for the new Bellingham Skatepark. It includes the user benefit input and potential economic input based on average visitors spending potential in Bellingham.

Visitors are based on the standard Bellingham tourist definition of people traveling to Bellingham by car from greater than 50 miles. It does not include the impact of the US/International fly tourism market. The report also does not apply any economic multiplier to the average daily visitor spending which is typically applied.

The report does not include the economic impact due to events or earned media marketing impact due to articles, posts, and other media generation.

## Research Basis Section

Peer Reviewed study by Dr. Thomas Kemp adapted for Bellingham
- Employs Travel Cost Model (TCM) to estimate user benefits (see JEA-04010090-Kemp.pdf)
- Visitor Spending based on Visit Bellingham data collection
- Dr. Kemp collaborated directly with the Northwest Skate Collective and Grindline teams to confirm this analysis

## Model Inputs / Justification Section

- Average Consumer surplus/visit: $61
  - Justification: Earth Economics / RCO reports support per-day values >$60; $61 is a conservative estimate, WA-specific figure agrees with Dr. Kemp.
- Skatepark Availability: 290 days
  - Justification: Five year average of days above 40 deg F in Bellingham. Not tied to rain days. Bellingham has ~150–170 wet days per year.
- Skatepark size: 16,000 sq ft
  - Justification: Per COB / Grindline Feasibility Study
- Skatepark projected Capital cost: $3,000,000
  - Justification: Per current skatepark budget estimates
- Conservative skatepark average users/day: 30
  - Justification: Per inputs from Dr. Kemp, Grindline, and existing usage of existing Bellingham Skateparks
- Optimistic skatepark average users/day: 120
  - Justification: Per inputs from Dr. Kemp, Grindline, and existing usage of existing Bellingham Skateparks
- Average Daily Visitor spending (meals, retail, transport): $70/user/visit 
  - Justification: Per Visit Bellingham analysis

The following inputs were not used for this analysis and are given to show potential more upside if they are included in future analysis
- Overnight Visitor spending (including lodging): $90/user/visit 
  - Justification: Per Visit Bellingham analysis. 
- Economic multipliers for local spending: 1.0
  - Justification: Studies show that a 1.5-2.0 multiplier can used on daily visitor spending to model the indirect impacts of user spending.
