Economic Impact Model for a Bellingham Skatepark: Tourism-Focused Cost-Benefit Analysis

The document JEA-040100900-2.pdf titled Shred Central: Estimating the user benefits associated with large public
skateparks is summarized below.

Based on the recent peer-reviewed analysis of the Lauridsen Skatepark in Des Moines, Iowa—the largest public skatepark in the U.S.—we can develop a tourism-focused economic model for a proposed Bellingham skatepark. The Des Moines study uses a travel cost model (TCM) and visitor surveys to estimate:
	• Per-user daily benefits (consumer surplus)
	• Overall economic surplus
	• Visitor characteristics, and
	• The park’s reach as a regional tourism draw.JEA-04010090-2.pdf
To present a credible, evidence-based financial outlook, below is a model for Bellingham under conservative and optimistic scenarios, tightly following published methodologies.

Key Assumptions & Parameters
	• Per-user daily consumer surplus: $61 (Des Moines, conservative estimate)JEA-04010090-2.pdf
	• Park open days: Assume 160 days/year (days above freezing or no rain, conservative)JEA-04010090-2.pdf
	• Average daily adult users: Conservative scenario: 30; Optimistic scenario: 120
		○ (Des Moines study assumes 50; adjust for Bellingham size, population, regional draw)
	• Annual benefit calculation: User benefit × Adult daily users × Days open
	• Spending multiplier: Visitors contribute more than just their “user benefit”—spending on meals, lodging, gas, and other retail via tourism. Standard local economic multipliers for visitor spending range from 1.5–2.0.

Financial Model Table
Scenario	Adult Users/Day	Days Open/Year	Total Annual Visits	Est. Annual User Benefit	Estimated Visitor Spending (Total)	Economic Multiplier	Modeled Total Economic Impact
Conservative	30	160	4,800	$292,800	$336,000	1.5	$504,000
Optimistic	120	160	19,200	$1,171,200	$1,344,000	2.0	$2,688,000

Notes:
	• “User benefit” is the direct non-market value measured via travel cost willingness to pay.JEA-04010090-2.pdf
	• “Estimated visitor spending” assumes $70 direct local spend/user/visit (meals, transport, shopping, based on tourism benchmarks and peer studies).
	• “Economic multiplier” reflects indirect/induced impacts as dollars circulate in the community.

Explanation & Justification
	• The travel cost model is the standard peer-reviewed basis for valuing public recreation infrastructure, as used in the Lauridsen study and many others.JEA-04010090-2.pdf
	• Conservative scenario reflects minimum expected usage (30 adults/day, incl. regional visitors).
	• Optimistic scenario models the impact if Bellingham attracts a comparably steady stream to high-visibility “destination” parks due to size/design/events.
	• Multiplier effect is well-supported in tourism economics: each dollar spent circulates and amplifies in the local economy.
	• The Lauridsen Skatepark’s model shows adult user-only annual benefits of $488,000, explicitly excluding minors and other community event impacts, thus making these Bellingham scenarios realistic and grounded in best available evidence.JEA-04010090-2.pdf

ROI and Community/Tourism Impact Takeaways
	• Even with conservative visitor assumptions, Bellingham’s investment in a sizable public skatepark could yield $504,000/year in total economic impact.
	• An optimistic but credible outlook would project nearly $2.7 million/year—on par with strong regional recreation or sports destinations.
	• Return on Investment (ROI): With concrete skateparks costing $50–$75/sq.ft., a 17,000 sq.ft park ($850,000–$1,275,000 initial cost) could “pay for itself” in direct and indirect economic impacts within 1–2 years in the optimistic scenario, and within 2–4 years conservatively.
	• The model excludes youth and family benefits, event/festival revenues, health outcomes, or reputation/diversification, all of which would further augment the park’s value.

Conclusion
A Bellingham public skatepark is likely to generate substantial annual economic benefits for the community, both through direct tourism spending and a powerful “multiplier effect” within the local economy. The peer-reviewed travel cost model offers a conservative and robust projection, while the optimistic scenario demonstrates the region’s real potential as a destination for action sports tourism. Both scenarios support a strong, defensible case for investment.

The Travel Cost Model (TCM): Overview and Application for Skatepark Economic Value
What is the Travel Cost Model?

The travel cost model (TCM) is a standard economic method for valuing recreational sites and public amenities where no direct market price exists. It estimates consumer surplus—the benefit visitors receive over and above what they pay—by analyzing how much people spend to visit (travel, lodging, time/opportunity cost).

Key Principles:
	• Revealed Preference: Visitors’ expenditure on travel acts as a proxy for their willingness to pay to access the site.
	• Observed Behavior: Models rely on actual travel/visit data, not hypothetical surveys.
	• Consumer Surplus: The core outcome is a dollar value per user-day, representing the net benefit enjoyed by each visitor above what they spend.

TCM Steps as Used in the Lauridsen Skatepark Study

1. Survey and Data Collection
	• Onsite surveys were conducted at the skatepark with 210 adult users over several days. (JEA-04010090-2.pdf)
	• Data captured: home ZIP code (for distance), travel costs (fuel, vehicle type), lodging, length of stay, annual income (for opportunity cost), group size, park usage frequency, and some demographic details.
2. Calculating Travel Cost per Visit
	• Vehicle operation costs: Based on AAA data—$0.54/mile for cars, $0.86/mile for trucks, onward from ZIP to park.JEA-04010090-2.pdf
	• Lodging and trip expenses: Actual self-reported costs, adjusted for trip duration.
	• Opportunity cost: 1/3 of daily wage per skatepark day (standard recreation economics assumption).JEA-04010090-2.pdf
3. Constructing the Demand Function
	• The number of trips per visitor (quantity demanded, Q) is modeled as a function of:
		○ Travel cost (P)
		○ Income
		○ Demographics and control variables (e.g., age, education, availability of substitute parks)
	• Negative binomial regression was selected over Poisson due to over-dispersion in trip counts (i.e., variance > mean).JEA-04010090-2.pdf
4. Estimating the Demand Curve
	• The demand curve specifies the expected number of visits as travel cost rises.
	• The regression yields (among others) a coefficient on travel cost (β1\beta_1β1), indicating how sensitive visitation is to cost.
5. Calculating Consumer Surplus
	• Formula: For the negative binomial specification, daily consumer surplus per user is calculated as:
CSD=−1β1CS_D = -\frac{1}{\beta_1}CSD=−β11 
Where CSDCS_DCSD is the daily consumer surplus and β1\beta_1β1 is the travel cost coefficient (from the regression).JEA-04010090-2.pdf
	• In the study, the travel cost coefficient (β1\beta_1β1) was −0.0163-0.0163−0.0163 in the NB model. So:
CSD=−1−0.0163≈$61CS_D = -\frac{1}{-0.0163} \approx \$61CSD=−−0.01631≈$61 
	• This figure means that, on average, each user receives approximately $61 of surplus value per skatepark day, over and above what they spend to get there.
6. Aggregation for Policy Impact
	• Multiply by estimated annual adult user-days to arrive at total annual benefit.
	• (Applicability: This can be scaled for different communities or projected for new facilities.)

Summary Table of Coefficient and Consumer Surplus Calculation
Variable	NB Model Coefficient	Consumer Surplus Formula	Result
Travel Cost (β1\beta_1β1)	-0.0163	-1/β₁	$61

Why Is This Robust?
	• Peer-reviewed and comparative: The $61 estimate aligns with values for other recreational amenities studied using TCM (e.g., mountain biking, surfing, parks).JEA-04010090-2.pdf
	• Controls for confounds: Income, group size, substitute amenities.
	• Conservative estimation: Full cost per day; excludes youth users.
	• Real-world revealed value: Not hypothetical; relies on actual expenditures and observed travel patterns.

How to Replicate
For Bellingham or future projects:
	• Conduct onsite surveys with standardized questions on travel cost, group size, stay duration, and income.
	• Calculate per-visit total cost.
	• Fit a (truncated) negative binomial regression of visits as a function of travel cost & controls.
	• Use −1/β1-1/\beta_1−1/β1 from the travel cost variable to arrive at daily consumer surplus.
	• Scale up by projected or observed user-days for annual economic benefit.

Conclusion:
The travel cost model offers a well-established, empirically robust method to quantify the true value of recreational assets like skateparks. The $61 per user daily consumer surplus found in Des Moines is the outcome of credible survey, econometric modeling, and mathematical estimation based on real visitor behavior.JEA-04010090-2.pdf
